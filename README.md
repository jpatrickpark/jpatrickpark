I am a PhD candidate in the Biomedical Imaging & Technology program at NYU School of Medicine, advised by Professor Krzysztof J. Geras.

I am working on the development and deployment of multimodal deep learning models for breast cancer screening, using 2D and 3D mammography images as well as ultrasound images.
